# Michelle's Portfolio
This repository provides documents and code meant to serve as representative samples of my work. The code projects are intentionally non-complex and aim for learning. They are intended to serve as a window into my coding habits, style, and thought processes to leverage my knowledge and hard skills for future complex development projects. This portfolio will continually evolve as I'm constantly improving myself.

Included are projects and description documents that were either created as personal items (on personal time, using my equipment, and not intended for any employers or clients) or were made during my college and internship period.
